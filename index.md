## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 7
I enjoyed this lab because it was one of the first challenging labs that made me feel like I was doing something practical as well. Thinking of ways to develop the parking rules was engaging and fun. It was also fun because my partner for the lab was really engaging as well.

Lab 8, Part 2
This lab was honestly enjoyable solely because of it's simplicity while also being informative on the topics learnt during that week. It made loops really clear on how they function, and their uses as well. It was nice to complete it quickly especially due to the first part of this lab being rather long and arduous.

Lab 6, Part 2
Creating the blackjack game was really fun, since I enjoy playing the game time to time. I think what also made this lab interesting, is the flexibility and potential was when writing the logic in this lab. It made it so that there was multiple ways to express certain cards, like the Ace. There was also multiple ways to show if your hand is a bust as well.
